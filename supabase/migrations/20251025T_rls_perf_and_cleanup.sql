-- =========================
-- RLS: performance + cleanup
-- =========================
-- Strategy:
-- 1) Enable RLS on all user-data tables (no-op if already enabled)
-- 2) DROP duplicate / old policies by name (IF EXISTS)
-- 3) CREATE a single clear policy per action, scoped TO authenticated
-- 4) Use (select auth.uid()) in USING / WITH CHECK to avoid initplan re-eval
